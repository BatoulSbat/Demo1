Answer here\n","* 2.1 Classifying emails as promotion or social based on their content and metadata:\n","\n","Appropriateness: Classification algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to categorise emails into one of two classes (promotion or social). Classification algorithms are suitable for this task as they can learn patterns from labeled data and make predictions based on features extracted from email content and metadata.\n","\n","* 2.2 Forecasting the stock price of a company based on historical data and market trends:\n","\n","Appropriateness: Regression algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: Stock price prediction involves predicting a continuous variable (i.e., the price of a stock) based on historical data and market trends. Regression algorithms are suitable for this task as they can learn the relationship between input features (e.g., historical stock prices, market indicators) and the target variable (i.e., stock price) to make predictions.\n","\n","* 2.3 Sorting images of animals into different species based on their visual features:\n","\n","Appropriateness: Classification algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: This is a multi-class classification problem where the goal is to assign images of animals to one of several species categories based on their visual features. Classification algorithms are appropriate for this task as they can learn to distinguish between different classes and assign new images to the most likely category.\n","\n","* 2.4 Predicting the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease based on medical history and diagnostic test results:\n","\n","Appropriateness: Classification algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: This is a binary or multi-class classification problem depending on the number of diseases being considered. The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have a specific disease based on their medical history and diagnostic test results. Classification algorithms are suitable for this task as they can learn from historical data to make predictions about the presence or absence of a disease."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b6f8UETG64hH"},"source":["3.

Answer here\n","* 3.1 Detecting anomalies in a manufacturing process using sensor data without prior knowledge of specific anomaly patterns.\n","\n","Appropriateness: Unsupervised learning algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: Since there is no prior knowledge of specific anomaly patterns, unsupervised learning is suitable for anomaly detection. Techniques like clustering or autoencoders can be used to identify patterns in the sensor data and detect deviations that indicate anomalies.\n","\n","* 3.2 Predicting customer lifetime value based on historical transaction data and customer demographics.\n","\n","Appropriateness: Supervised learning algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: This is a regression problem where the goal is to predict a continuous value (customer lifetime value) based on input features (historical transaction data and customer demographics).

Clustering algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering are commonly used for this purpose.\n","\n","* 3.4 Analysing social media posts to categorise them into different themes.\n","\n","Appropriateness: Supervised learning algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: Categorising social media posts into different themes is a classification problem that requires labeled data. Supervised learning algorithms are appropriate as they can learn from labeled examples to categorise new posts into predefined themes.

Answer here\n","* 4.1 Predicting fraudulent financial transactions using a dataset where most transactions are labelled as fraudulent or legitimate.\n","\n","Appropriateness: No, supervised learning algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: Since most transactions are already labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, a supervised learning algorithm is appropriate. The model can learn directly from the labeled data, which is abundant, to make accurate predictions.\n","\n","* 4.2 Analysing customer satisfaction surveys where only a small portion of the data is labelled with satisfaction ratings.\n","\n","Appropriateness: Yes, semi-supervised learning algorithm.\n","\n","Justification: Since only a small portion of the data is labeled, semi-supervised learning is suitable.
